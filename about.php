					<p>A knowledge management system (KMS) is a system for applying and using knowledge management principles. These include data-driven objectives around business productivity, a competitive business model, business intelligence analysis and more.

A knowledge management system is made up of different software modules served by a central user interface. Some of these features can allow for data mining on customer input and histories, along with the provision or sharing of electronic documents. Knowledge management systems can help with staff training and orientation, support better sales, or help business leaders to make critical decisions.</p>
